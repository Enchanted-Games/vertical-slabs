# Enchanted Vertical Slabs
A simple, vanilla-like mod that adds vertical slabs to Minecraft. They can be crafted the same way a normal slab can in a crafting table just vertically instead of horizontally. This mod is a fabric mod that requires [Fabric API](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fabric-api) to function.
