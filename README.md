# Enchanted Vertical Slabs
A simple, vanilla-like mod that adds vertical slabs to the game. They can be crafted the same way a normal slab can in a crafting table just vertically instead of horizontally. This mod is a fabric mod that requires [Fabric API](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fabric-api) to function.

# v1.4 Notes
v1.4 includes some major changes to do with BetterEnd compatibility.

 - To get the BetterEnd vertical slabs you now need to download a seperate mod (see below)
 - Any BetterEnd vertical slabs made in v1.3 of the main mod may not be compatible with *Enchanted Vertical Slabs - BetterEnd Edition*. Please make a backup if you are planning on upgrading.

The seperating will make the mod easier to maintain and also fixes some issues with error spam in the logs. It will also make it easier to create more compatibility mods in the future.

# Sub Mods
**[Enchanted Vertical Slabs - BetterEnd Edition](https://github.com/Enchanted-Games/vertical-slabs-betterend)** 
> BetterEnd Edition is a seperate mod that adds vertical slabs for the BetterEnd mod.

You do not need the main mod istalled though it is recommended. You must install BetterEnd alongside *Enchanted Vertical Slabs - BetterEnd Edition* otherwise the vertical slabs will not show up correctly.
